/**
 * Title of problem statement : Find the Rotation Count in Rotated Sorted array(ascending order)
 *
 * Problem statement :
 * Consider an array of distinct numbers sorted in increasing order.
 * The array has been rotated (clockwise) k number of times. Given such an array, find the value of k.
 *
 * Approach for this problem statement
 * 1. Using linear search
 * 2. Using Binary Search
 * Let the array be arr[] = [15, 18, 2, 3, 6, 12] and Initial array must be {2, 3, 6, 12, 15, 18}
 * A = [1, 2] and B = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
 * <p>
 * Reverse A, we get ArB = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
 * Reverse B, we get ArBr = [2, 1, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3]
 * Reverse all, we get (ArBr)r = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2]
